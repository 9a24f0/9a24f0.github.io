                    <p>
                        Oi, I've been to hell and back with the deployment on Heroku (the reason was all
                        about my situation, not the host). There were such problems left unanswered or even yet
                        to be asked on exchange forums. However, from individual posts and advice,
                        collected as a whole, I've managed to overcome my problem.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="d-flex mb-3"><b>Deploying on Heroku is such an easy task with tutorials are you joking?</b></h5>
                    <p>
                        Well, technically yes, but that's the case when you are using a non-proprietary database.
                        MSSQL addon on Heroku charged 5$/month, which is a problem with undergraduates who
                        are not financial independence. In my case, I asked my supervisor to provide me a
                        server and connects with SQL authentication and this solves the pricing problem.
                        However, this server was quite old <i>(Microsoft SQL Server 2012 - 11.0.5058.0)</i>,
                        and that was the root of all troubles. I'm not having such privilege to upgrade the server,
                        so I have to work around with what I have.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="d-flex mb-3"><b>Everything starts with good vibe...</b></h5>
                    <p>
                        Before deploying, I tried to set up a local page to check the settings. Everything was perfect!
                        Then I install Heroku CLI, start adding buildpacks and again host local web using Heroku.
                        Everything looks great! With all my confidence, I pushed to Heroku's git and deployed
                        the web. Yay, landing page looks cool. Not and all navigations behaves correctly. Not until I tried
                        to intefere with the database when it responded:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Well, of couse I expect some missteps from myself since this is my first time deploying.
                        However, this is still strange since I tried host local web using Heroku's <i>config vars</i> 
                        and nothing went wrong. I reviewed the log, the error was:
                    </p>

                        When I checked <code>/etc/</code>, there was no <code>odbcinst.ini</code>. Surely the
                        Dyno could not find it and fallback to default setting. Additionally, I forgot to install
                        <code>msodbc</code>. Having looked around for solutions, I bumped into a true gold conversation

                        Errr... what? SSL problem? I had again look for various forums. The problem was the minimum
                        protocol of Ubuntu 20.04 being TLSv1.2, while old server use TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1.
                        All answers were to modify <code>/etc/ssl/openssl.conf</code> and to set <code>MinProtocol=TLSv1.0</code>.
                        However, since I'm on remote shell, not root, I did not have privilege to modify such file.

                        Besides,
                        my local machine could connect to the server with out changing any configuration. I rechecked OpenSSL
                        version, and it turned out the version on Dyno was 1.1.1f compared to 1.1.1k on my machine. Thus I decided
                        to update OpenSSL <a href="https://github.com/9a24f0/heroku-buildpack-openssl">via a buildpack</a>.
                        Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/benlast">@Ben Last</a> with his excellent work
                        that I could upgrade the version with ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last work was to reconfigure <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> so that two versions not
                        conflict with each other. I would rather modify the buildpack to achieve correct path right away,
                        though seemingly the dyno wiped off <code>tmp/</code> during deployment. As we all know, it is what it is,
                        and here are steps to work around:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>On dyno, run the following command and copy the correct path
                            <pre>$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/openssl/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH} && echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre></li>
                        <li> After that, simply set Heroku's environment variable as
                            <pre>
                                $ heroku config:set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=your-copied-path
                            </pre>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After this, we achieve such thing as:</p>

                    <p>
                        So what have I learnt from this? First thing is how to deploy on a cloud VM, where
                        we were given the resource but not the privilege. Seriously, the problem was not so
                        complicated as such if I could have a VM to install everything the same as my machine.
                        But hey, I've learnt how to work around with such limited permission, so better give a
                        thanks for the situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, you should have your system updated. As of currently available Ubuntu 20.04 and 20.10,
                        the OpenSSL version is still 1.1.1f, which could not connect to SQL Server 12. Normal
                        company would have a life span of more than 10 years with a database not upgraded.
                        The version that I provided was release on June 2014, and it's not yet 10 years since then.
                        Upgrade to Ubuntu 21 provides you with 1.1.1j, which solves the problem directly and
                        without any configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, if you could somehow have permission to upgrade the old database, do it rightaway.
                        I saw many questions about how to connects to a 2008 SQL Server, which is officially unsupported by
                        Microsoft now. The 2012 version is somehow under support since the extended date would be July 2022.
                        Yeah I believe my opinion about upgrading the database will be accepted soon, but we will save it
                        for a rainy day.
