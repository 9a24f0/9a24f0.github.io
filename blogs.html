                        Oi, I've been to hell and back with the deployment on Heroku (the reason was all
                        about my situation, not the host). There were such problems left unanswered or even yet
                        to be asked on exchange forums. However, from individual posts and advice,
                        collected as a whole, I've managed to overcome my problem.

                        I recently received a survey from <a href="https://vass.gov.vn/Pages/Index.aspx" class="text-info">VASS</a>
                        about student's awareness of personal finance. I found an interesting quiz that at first
                        make no sense until I took my pen and actually start work on it.

                        I'm a third year student and about to graduate.
                        During my studie-ing process, I had to write a decent chunk of papers and reports,
                        and none of those report and slides was written using office's tool like Word or Powerpoint.
                        So why I'm become so hated of office's tool? And what I used to replace those?
